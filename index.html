            Hola a todos! My name is Gerard. I'm currently a student at Codex Academy learning about the use of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 
            I've previously done coding in 2012 with a Intro to Web Design course that I took in college. 
            I was an engineering major at the time but did not pursue software development. 
            A goal that keeps me awake is improving my spanish so that I can travel to Central and South America. 
            A few fun facts about me is that my favorite color is navy blue and I am left-handed. 
        </p>
